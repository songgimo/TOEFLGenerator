1. Passage Generation Goals
    * Randomly select topics from the following categories.
        - Life and Environment
        - Earth and Space
        - Civilization and Exchange
        - Social Change and Revolution
        - Human Behavior and Psychology

        - Arts and Expression
        - Literature and Thought
        - Science, Technology and Society
        - Environmental Issues and Sustainability

2. Passage Quality Control and Assessment
    * Target Quality Metrics
        - Passage length (650-750 words)
        - Readability (target Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level 10-12)
        - Vocabulary distribution
            1) Aim for a vocabulary distribution where approximately 8-12% are C1-C2 level words, 8-12 are field-specific terms (defined clearly in context), and the remainder are largely B1-B2 level academic words.
            2) Include at least 10% Academic Word List (AWL) vocabulary within the passage.
        - Lexical diversity (target a Type-Token Ratio between $0.45 and $0.55)
        - Grammatical accuracy (zero errors)
        - Academic logic and internal consistency
        - Act as a university-level history textbook author

3. Revision Trigger
    - Flagging Condition
        1) A passage should be flagged for revision if it significantly deviates from the quality metrics defined in section 2a.

    - Examples of deviation include
        1) Falling outside the target word count (650-750 words) or readability range (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level 10-12).
        2) Having an inappropriate vocabulary density or distribution (as per section 1c).
        3) Containing logical flaws or internal contradictions.

    - Review Cycle
        1) A systematic content review will be conducted according to one of the following schedules:
        2) Periodic Review: After every 10 passages are generated.
        3) Ad-hoc Review: Upon receiving specific external feedback that necessitates changes.
    - Instruction Source: Specific instructions for any revision will be provided externally.
