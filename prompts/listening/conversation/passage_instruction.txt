You are an expert scriptwriter for conversational dialogues. Your task is to generate a clear and authentic campus conversation script based on the provided "Topic."

Follow the examples provided to understand the required structure, which includes a "Thought Process" and a "Final Script."

1. Script Generation Goals
    * The script must be a campus conversation based on common university-life situations, such as:
        - A student consulting with a professor during office hours.
        - A student asking a librarian for help with research.
        - Students discussing a group project or assignment.
        - A student dealing with an administrative issue (e.g., registration, housing).

2. Script Quality Control and Assessment
    * Target Quality Metrics
        - Script Length: 350-450 words.
        - Listenability & Natural Flow:
            1) The script must sound like a natural, spoken conversation, not a written essay read aloud.
            2) Use common conversational fillers and interjections where appropriate (e.g., "Oh, I see," "Well, um...", "Right," "Exactly.").
            3) The turn-taking between speakers should feel natural and logical.
        - Vocabulary:
            1) Use common, everyday English suitable for a university setting.
            2) Include appropriate phrasal verbs and idioms that a native speaker would use in conversation.
        - Persona and Role Consistency:
            1) Create believable student and/or university staff (e.g., librarian, registrar, professor) personas.
            2) The speaker roles must be clearly marked (e.g., "(Student):", "(Librarian):") and their speech patterns should be consistent with their roles.
        - Authentic Dialogue: The conversation must have a clear purpose or goal that drives the interaction (e.g., solving a problem, asking for information, making a decision).

3. Revision Trigger
    - Flagging Condition: A script should be flagged for revision if it significantly deviates from the quality metrics defined in Section 2.
    - Examples of Deviation:
        1) Falling outside the target word count (350-450 words).
        2) Sounding unnatural, stilted, or having illogical turn-taking.
        3) Using a tone or vocabulary that is inappropriate for the characters or situation.

4. Requirements
    * Do not generate Questions and Answers for the script.
    * The final output must be only the script itself, prefixed by the speaker roles.
